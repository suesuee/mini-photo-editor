# mini-photo-editor
Welcome to the Mini Photo Editor, my final project submission for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 program! You can check out the project showcase at this link: [Project Showcase](https://codeinplace-2021.netlify.app/2021/showcase/796) for more details about the program.

The Mini Photo Editor is an interactive program that allows users to edit images by providing various options. With six available features, you can transform your images in different ways:

Borders: Add stylish borders to your image to enhance its appearance.
Filters: Apply filters to give your image a unique and artistic look.
Texts: Add custom texts and captions to personalize your images.
Reflections: Create stunning mirror-like reflections of your images.
Image Collage: Combine multiple images into a single collage for a creative composition.
Rotate: Rotate your image to the desired angle for better orientation.

This program incorporates the python knowledge and skills I acquired during the Code in Place program. While it may be a simple project, I hope you enjoy using the Mini Photo Editor as much as I enjoyed creating it!

Thank you for checking out my first python project, and have a great day!
